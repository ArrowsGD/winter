# Pre-trained NLP Transformer model

## Summary
I will build a free and public API for a natural language processing model similar to OpenAI's GPT 
and Google's laMDA. You can ask it a question or give it a task, the model will respond and give you an 
intelligent answer based on what it has learned. I also plan to add support for your custom training data if you 
want to train the model in a specific area.

## Plan

The first step of this project will be collecting information from various books, Wikipedia articles, 
and data collected from Common Crawl. With this data, I will use Pytorch to construct a transformer
machine-learning model to train on this data. Once all of this is done, I will use Flask to develop a 
public API that any developer can use.
